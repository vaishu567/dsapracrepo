DSA Roadmap With Python ðŸ‘‡

1. Introduction to Python:

-Learn the basics of Python syntax, data types, and control structures.
-Understand functions, modules, and libraries in Python.

2. Basic Data Structures in Python:

-Lists, Stacks, and Queues:
-Operations, implementation, and use cases.

-Tuples and Sets:
-Properties and applications.

3. Advanced Data Structures in Python:

Dictionaries:
-Operations, time complexity, and use cases.

Linked Lists:
-Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and their implementations.

4. Time Complexity and Big-O Notation:

-Analyze the time complexity of algorithms.
-Understand Big-O notation and its significance.

5. Sorting Algorithms:

-Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort.
-Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
-Compare and contrast different sorting algorithms.

6. Searching Algorithms:

-Linear Search, Binary Search.
-Hashing and Hash Tables.

7. Recursion:

-Understand recursion and its applications.
-Solve problems using recursion.

8. Trees:

-Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees (BST).
-Tree traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
-AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees.

9. Graphs:

-Graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list).
-Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
-Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford).

10. Dynamic Programming:

-Understand dynamic programming concepts.
-Solve problems using memoization and bottom-up approaches.

11. Greedy Algorithms:

-Understand the greedy approach.
-Solve problems using greedy algorithms.

12. Advanced Topics:

-Trie data structure.
-Union-Find (Disjoint Set) data structure.
-Segment Trees.
-Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees).

13. Practice and Challenges:

-Solve coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces.
-Implement algorithms from scratch.

This repository is for DSA practice using Python and Java for 60 days. I am learning from Strivers Playlist.
